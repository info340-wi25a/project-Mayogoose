# VoxTune - Online tool for singers to warm up
## Project Overview
**VoxTune** is an interactive online web tool designed to help singers of all levels warm up effectively and perform vocal exercises tailored to their needs. VoxTune is different from a static web page or searching for keywords on YouTube every time you practice. It is a dynamic, data-driven web page that allows users to interact with and modify the content in a personalized way to create a playlist that is exclusive to them. Additionally warmups are recommended based on the user's personal situation.

## Main Features
### 1. Interactive vocal exercise system (use case)
Upload new warmups to the website
- Users can choose from a variety of vocal warm-up exercises and create their own playlists for subsequent practice based on their range, skill level, and goals (such as pitch accuracy, breath control, or vocal strength).
- Users can save their customized exercise routines for future use, creating a personalized warm-up library.

### 2. User-generated data and customization
Organize and reorganize warmups into playlists for later use
- Based on the warmups entered by the user, the app dynamically adjusts the exercises and displays relevant data (e.g., progress over time, suggested exercises).
- Users can also modify and reorganize the order of exercises to create a tailored warm-up experience based on their preferences. And they can view their own playlists in their profile by logging into their account.

### 3. Search and filter functions (mini-functions)
Search and filter specific warmups or playlists
- Users can search for specific vocal exercises by keywords (e.g., "breath control", "high notes") This allows users to narrow down exercises by difficulty level or range.
- This feature helps users quickly find exercises that meet their needs and preferences.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
