    <h1>Music App Proposal</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Singers, whether performing solo or in groups, require regular vocal warm-ups to maintain vocal health, extend their range, and ensure a quality performance. However, one information problem they often face is limited access to engaging, high-quality, and diverse vocal warm-up exercises. The lack of variety can result in boredom or insufficient preparation, especially for singers in groups who may have varying ranges and skill levels. Many singers feel their warm-ups fail to adequately address their unique needs, leaving them unprepared or fatigued during performances.</p>
        <p>Currently, singers often rely on prerecorded warm-ups available on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and TikTok. However, with most videos lasting over 10 minutes, it is challenging to identify which exercises are included without listening to the entire video. These platforms also lack filters that support singers' specific needs. Singers often rely on keywords and algorithms to discover warm-ups that meet their specific needs, which can be time-consuming. Moreover, built-in methods in these platforms for collecting and organizing vocal warm-ups are not singer-friendly. Alternatively, singers join groups and rely on an experienced group member to lead the exercises. However, this approach often unintentionally caters to a limited vocal range or skill level, leaving some members without an effective warm-up tailored to their needs. Hence, existing solutions fall short in providing personalized, adaptive, and fun warm-up experiences for singers.</p>
